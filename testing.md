Query> Which system has the most problems?

[DEBUG] Tools used: db2.all_systems_health

AI: The system with the most problems is **ZT03**, based on the highest number of critical and warning health issues:

- **ZT03**: 326 critical + 306 warning = **632 total problematic rules**
- **ZT01**: 247 critical + 308 warning = **555 total problematic rules**
- **ZT02**: 90 critical + 90 warning = **180 total problematic rules**

### Key Details:
- **ZT03** has the highest severity issues (critical + warning) across all systems.
- **ZT01** has the largest total number of rules checked (6,710), but fewer severe issues compared to ZT03.
- **ZT02** has the fewest problematic rules but still shows notable issues.

### Next Steps:
1. Investigate **ZT03**'s critical issues (e.g., DB2Z, SYID rule groups).

| **Critical**     | 247 (3.2%)      | 326 (1.6%)      |
| **Warning**      | 308 (4.0%)      | 431 (2.1%)      |
| **Good**         | 6,966 (89.8%)   | 19,781 (95.9%)  |
| **Worst Rule Group** | SYID (1.52 severity) | DB2Z (1.55 severity) |

**Key Findings:**
1. **ZT03** has more **critical** and **warning** issues overall (326 vs 247 critical; 431 vs 308 warning) despite having 2.6x more total rules.
2. **ZT01** has higher severity in **SYID** (1.52) and **LPAR** (1.27), while **ZT03** has higher severity in **DB2Z** (1.55) and **DASD** (1.2).
3. Both systems have rule groups with **no critical issues** (e.g., DASD, MMRY, PATH in ZT01; LPAR, MMRY, PATH in ZT03).

**Recommendations:**
- Prioritize **ZT03's DB2Z** rule group (1.55 severity) for critical fixes.

[DEBUG] Tools used: db2.problem_areas

AI: There are no direct memory-related issues detected in the recent 30-day window. However, the system is showing **663 critical issues** and **889 warnings** across 3 systems, primarily affecting DB2Z (database) and DASD (storage) components. Key problems include:

---

### **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention**
1. **Deferred Write Thresholds** (Systems ZT03, ZT01)
   - Indicates potential storage I/O bottlenecks or buffer pool inefficiencies.
   - Impact: May lead to increased disk contention and slower transaction processing.

2. **Lock Timeouts** (System ZT03)
   - Suggests database contention or long-running transactions blocking others.
   - Impact: Reduced application throughput and user-visible delays.

3. **DASD Response Intensity** (System ZT03)
   - High disk workload intensity could signal storage subsystem overload.
   - Impact: Risk of I/O bottlenecks and degraded performance for disk-dependent workloads.

4. **Parked Engines** (System ZT01)
   - Unused LPAR resources may indicate misconfigured workload distribution.
   - Impact: Wasted capacity and potential inefficiencies in resource allocation.

---

### **Next Steps**
- **Check Storage Metrics**: Use `db2.system_health(system_id="ZT03")` to investigate DASD response intensity and deferred write thresholds.
- **Review Lock Contention**: Analyze DB2Z lock timeouts via `KPMZ_RULE_VALUES_V` for rule `DB2Z_002`.
- **Optimize LPAR Configuration**: Investigate parked engines on ZT01 for resource allocation inefficiencies.
